# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

With some exceptions, only the latest minor version (4.x), currently receive patches for security vulnerabilities. 
The previous minor version _might_ be patched if the fix is simple. No update shall be done to previous major version (aka 3.x) or previous minor releases at this time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to the main contributors (listed below) by contacting us directly or on [Chat](https://chat.userfrosting.com). 
If you have a fix, don't hesitate to explain or attach it. Using the issue system should be avoided for suspected security vulnerabilities.
