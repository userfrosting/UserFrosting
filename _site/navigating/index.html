                <h2>Dependency Management with Composer</h2>
                
                <p>
                UserFrosting builds on top of a number of existing components.  After all, why reinvent the wheel if there is already a well-documented, well-tested solution?  However, new versions of these <em>dependencies</em> are released all the time, and it can be difficult to keep up with changes.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                To efficiently manage UserFrosting&#39;s dependencies, we use <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>.  Composer is a dependency management tool that you can install locally on your development workstation.  When run from the command line in your project directory, it consults a special schema file, <a href="userfrosting/composer.json"><code>composer.json</code></a>, and downloads the dependencies defined in that file from a central repository called <a href="https://packagist.org/">Packagist</a>.  By default and by convention, each component is placed in a separate subdirectory of the <code>vendor</code> directory.  <a href="userfrosting/vendor">UserFrosting&#39;s <code>vendor</code> directory</a> is located in the <code>userfrosting</code> directory.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Composer also <strong>autoloads</strong> the files and classes from these packages.  This means that instead of having a long list of <code>require</code> statements in the config file, we only need to include one file, <code>vendor/autoload.php</code>.  This file is automatically generated by Composer by scanning the package contents.  Composer can also autoload the files and classes that are specific to UserFrosting.  When you run <code>composer update</code>, Composer will scan the <code>controllers</code>, <code>middleware</code>, and <code>models</code> directories for new files and classes.
                </p>
                
                <h3><a id="user-content-installing-composer" class="anchor" href="#installing-composer" aria-hidden="true"></a>Installing Composer</h3>
                
                <p>For your convenience, the latest versions of UserFrosting&#39;s dependencies are already included in this repository.  However, if you choose to use UserFrosting for your own project, you will likely want to do one or more of these things:</p>

                <ul>
                <li>Install a package that isn&#39;t already included;</li>
                <li>Update a package to a newer version;</li>
                <li>Add your own files and class definitions to the core codebase.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>In this case, you will need to install Composer.</p>
                
                <p>To install composer on a Mac or other Unix-like operating system, visit <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx">install it</a>.  It is recommended that you install it globally.</p>
                
                <p>To add additional dependencies, you will need to modify the <code>userfrosting/composer.json</code> file.  After this, run <code>composer update</code> in the <code>userfrosting</code> subdirectory to install the new dependencies.</p>
                
                <p>All dependencies are installed in <code>userfrosting/vendor</code>.  <strong>Do not manually change the contents of this directory!</strong>  The contents of this directory are automatically managed by Composer.</p>
                
                <p>Libraries which have been installed with composer are autoloaded, so there is no need to include individual files.  All you need is the <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> file, which is already included in <code>userfrosting/config-userfrosting.php</code>.  See the &quot;Configuration&quot; section for more information on the config file.</p>

                <h2 id="toc_2">Front Controllers and the Slim Microframework</h2>
                <p>If you&#39;re coming from the 0.1.x or 0.2.x versions of UserFrosting, you&#39;ve probably noticed that the flow of the code has changed substantially.  In particular, we now use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Controller_pattern"><strong>front controller pattern</strong></a>, also known as a URL router, which creates a layer of abstraction between the URL that you visit (for example, http://mysite.com/dashboard) and the code that gets run.</p>
                
                <p>If you&#39;re new to PHP, you&#39;ve probably been using the <strong>one-url-one-file</strong> scheme.  This means that, in the document root of the filesystem on your server (for example, <code>/~alexw/dev/htdocs/</code>), you create <code>.php</code> files that correspond to the URLs that users of your site can visit.  So, you might have a file <code>/~alexw/dev/htdocs/command-center.php</code>, and then you visit <code>http://localhost/command-center.php</code> to see the output of this script.</p>
                
                <p>But here&#39;s the deal: there&#39;s no law set in stone that says it <em>has</em> to work this way.  When you visit a URL, all you&#39;re really doing is placing an HTTP <code>GET</code> <strong>request</strong> to a server (e.g., Apache).  The request is basically asking the server to generate the appropriate <strong>response</strong> to that request.  In the case of your typical home setup with Apache and PHP, the default behavior for a request is to look for a PHP script with the same name (<code>command-center.php</code>) in some preconfigured document root directory, run it, and send its output back as the response, where it is displayed in the client&#39;s browser.</p>
                
                <p>However, it is possible to configure the server to interpret requests differently - this is known as <strong>routing</strong>.  Why would you want to do this?  Because it gives you more flexibility.  Let&#39;s say you want your site to have a URL like <code>http://mysite.com/blog/2015-06-01/1</code>, which points to the first page of your blog posts from June 1.  Without routing, you&#39;d need to have actual subdirectories on your server&#39;s filesystem - <code>/~alexw/dev/htdocs/blog/2015-06-01/1.php</code>.</p>
                
                <p>What&#39;s wrong with this?  Well, let&#39;s say you want the same blog post to also appear at other URLs, for example <code>http://mysite.com/blog/rants</code> and <code>http://mysite.com/blog/favorites/1</code>.  You&#39;d need to have these subdirectories as well, and you&#39;d have to create actual scripts that output the same content.  This becomes even more problematic if you want dynamically generated URLs, like <code>http://mysite.com/blog/words-from-a-database</code>.</p>
                
                <p>On the other hand, with a front controller, you can link URLs to specific pieces of code without needing to create a separate file.</p>
                
                <h3 id="toc_3">How does UserFrosting make this happen?</h3>
                
                <p>UserFrosting uses the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim Framework</a> to make this work.  Here&#39;s how:</p>
                
                <ol>
                <li> When a user visits a URL such as <code>http://mysite.com/users/u/1</code>, they are actually seeing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_engine">rewritten URL</a>.  <small>In reality, every request is sent to <code>index.php</code>, with <code>users/u/1</code> sent as a request parameter.  In Apache, this is done with an <code>.htaccess</code> file (a preconfigured <code>.htaccess</code> file is included with UserFrosting).  Other web server technologies may use a different type of configuration file.</small></li>
                <li>In <code>index.php</code>, a number of routes are defined, <small>which tell it how to respond based on the request parameter.  Slim provides the framework for handling these routes.  For example:</small></li>
                </ol>
                
                <pre>
$app-&gt;get(&#39;/users/u/1/?&#39;, function () use ($app) {
    echo &quot;Hello I am user number 1&quot;;
});
                </pre>
                
                <p>generates the output for <code>http://mysite.com/users/u/1</code>.  <code>$app</code> is the Slim application (a global variable), and <code>get</code> tells us that we are dealing with a <code>GET</code> request (any time you navigate to a URL in your browser, you are submitting a <code>GET</code> request).</p>
                
                <p>Another advantage is that routes can have variables in them.  For example:</p>
                
                <pre>
$app-&gt;get(&#39;/users/u/:user_id/?&#39;, function ($user_id) use ($app) {
    echo &quot;Hello I am user number $user_id&quot;;
});
                </pre>
                
                <p>Now we can visit any URL, for example <code>http://mysite.com/users/u/27</code>, and we will get the corresponding output &quot;Hello I am user number 27.&quot;</p>

                <h2>Code Structure and MVC</h2>
                <p>The code for UserFrosting is divided into two main folders - <code>public</code> and <code>userfrosting</code>.  <code>public</code> is the directory that faces the world; any file that a visitor to your site can directly access is in this directory.  Everything else is in <code>userfrosting</code>.
                </p>

                </pre>
                
                <p>If you&#39;re new to URL routing and the front controller pattern, you may be wondering - how can everything be accessible from <code>public</code> when I only see one<code>.php</code> file in there?</p>
                
                <p><strong>Don&#39;t panic -</strong> this is how it&#39;s supposed to work.  The content and behavior of each page are no longer locked up into individual <code>.php</code> files.  Instead, all URLs are redirected to <code>index.php</code> (via the <code>.htaccess</code> file if you&#39;re using Apache).  <code>index.php</code> then calls the appropriate <strong>controller</strong>, which generates the appropriate content for the requested page.</p>
                
                <p>For example, here is the <strong>router code</strong> in <code>index.php</code> that handles the user management page (<code>http://yoursite.com/users</code>):</p>
                
                <pre>
$app-&gt;get(&#39;/users/?&#39;, function () use ($app) {
    $controller = new UF\UserController($app);
    return $controller-&gt;pageUsers();
});
                </pre>
                
                <p><code>$app</code> is the global <a href="#slim">Slim</a> object.  The <code>get</code> method defines a <strong>route</strong>, which is a URL that your website can accept and generate a response to.  Any time you type a URL into your browser, you are submitting a <code>GET</code> request to the web server.</p>
                
                <p>The line</p>
                
                <p><code>$controller = new UF\UserController($app);</code></p>
                
                <p>tells us to create a new <code>UserController</code> object, which is responsible for mediating the interaction between what the client sees (the <strong>view</strong>) and the data and methods that constitute the user accounts (the <strong>model</strong>).</p>
                
                <p>All controller classes for UserFrosting are located in <code>userfrosting/controllers/</code>. </p>
                
                <p>Think of <code>index.php</code> as a receptionist at a big company.  The various pages that your site&#39;s visitors navigate to are the employees.  When a client wants to visit an employee, they don&#39;t go straight to their office - instead, they see the receptionist, tell him where they want to go, get checked in, and then get passed along to a security escort.  The security escort controls their interaction with the members and resources of the company.</p>
                
                <p><code>UserController::pageUsers()</code> is the method responsible for mediating this particular interaction, namely, the rendering of a table of users as HTML.  By convention, any controller method that generates a complete HTML document is prefixed with <code>page</code>.</p>
                
                <p>Now, let&#39;s look at the code for the <code>pageUsers</code> function, which is in <code>userfrosting/controllers/UserController.php</code>:</p>
                
                <pre>
/**
 * Renders the user listing page.
 *
 * This page renders a table of users, with dropdown menus for admin actions for each user.
 * Actions typically include: edit user details, activate user, enable/disable user, delete user.
 * This page requires authentication.
 * Request type: GET
 * @param string $primary_group_name optional.  If specified, will only display users in that particular primary group.
 * @param bool $paginate_server_side optional.  Set to true if you want UF to load each page of results via AJAX on demand, rather than all at once.

                <p>This controller method can actually accept two kinds of requests: a request to show a table of <em>all</em> users, or a request to show a table of users from a single primary group.  To keep it simple for now, let&#39;s just look at the part after the <code>else</code> statement, which loads the table for all users:</p>
                
                <pre>
// Access-controlled page
if (!$this-&gt;_app-&gt;user-&gt;checkAccess(&#39;uri_users&#39;)){
    $this-&gt;_app-&gt;notFound();
}
  
if (!$paginate_server_side) {
    $user_collection = User::get();
    $user_collection-&gt;getRecentEvents(&#39;sign_in&#39;);
    $user_collection-&gt;getRecentEvents(&#39;sign_up&#39;, &#39;sign_up_time&#39;);                
}
$name = &quot;Users&quot;;
$icon = &quot;fa fa-users&quot;;
                </pre>
                
                <p>First, we check to make sure that the current user has permission to access this content.  <code>$this-&gt;_app-&gt;user</code> references the currently logged-in user, and <code>checkAccess</code> consults the database to determine whether the user has permission to access a certain resource.  Resources are indicated by <strong>authorization hooks</strong> - in this case, <code>uri_users</code>.  The database contains a set of authorization rules, which map authorization hooks to users and groups.</p>
                
                <p>Next, we load the collection of all users, using the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.0/eloquent#introduction">Eloquent ORM</a>.  The <code>User::get()</code> method returns a collection of <code>User</code> objects.  This collection is an instance of a special class that acts like an array (we can iterate over it), but can be extended with other methods for additional functionality.  For example, the <code>getRecentEvents</code> method fetches recent events for each <code>User</code> in the collection.  Internally, this is done by joining the <code>user</code> and <code>user_event</code> tables - but we don&#39;t have to get our hands messy with SQL statements!</p>
                
                <p>Once we&#39;ve loaded the data we want, we set some other dynamic parameters for the page we&#39;re about to render, and then pass everything into the <code>$this-&gt;_app-&gt;render</code> method as an array:</p>
                
                <pre>
$this-&gt;_app-&gt;render(&#39;users/users.twig&#39;, [
    &quot;box_title&quot; =&gt; $name,
    &quot;icon&quot; =&gt; $icon,
    &quot;primary_group_name&quot; =&gt; $primary_group_name,
    &quot;paginate_server_side&quot; =&gt; $paginate_server_side,
    &quot;users&quot; =&gt; isset($user_collection) ? $user_collection-&gt;toArray() : []
]);
                </pre>
                
                <p>The template file for this page, <code>users.twig</code>, is a basically just an HTML file that supports dynamically generated content via Twig placeholders and tags.  <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a> is a templating engine that helps us to better separate the logic (which is the controller&#39;s responsibility) from the presentation (which is encapsulated by the Twig template).  This particular template file can be found in <code>userfrosting/templates/themes/default/users/</code>.</p>
                
                <p>In addition to the parameters that we pass in via <code>render</code>, Twig has access to a number of global parameters.  These are defined using Twig&#39;s <code>addGlobal</code> method in the <code>setupTwig</code> and <code>setupTwigUserVariables</code> methods in <a href="http://www.userfrosting.com/api/class-UserFrosting.UserFrosting.html">models/UserFrosting.php</a>.</p>
                
                <p>After the call to <code>render</code>, everything is handed off to Twig, which generates the actual HTML that is sent back to the user.  You can read more about this in <a href="#twig">creating content with Twig</a>. Congratulations!  You&#39;ve now seen the sequence of steps whereby UserFrosting generates the appropriate content for a particular <code>GET</code> request.</p>

                <h3 id="toc_6">Template Files and Dynamic Content</h3>
                
                <p>If you&#39;re unfamiliar with the MVC paradigm, you may be used to seeing PHP code that looks like this:</p>
                
                <pre>
echo &quot;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Username&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Email&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;;

$stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT * FROM users);
$stmt-&gt;execute($sqlVars);

while ($r = $stmt-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
    echo &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;$r[&#39;user_name&#39;]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$r[&#39;email&#39;]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;;
}

echo &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot;;
                </pre>
                
                <p>We have the code that loads user data from the database all mixed into the code that actually displays the page.  This is commonly referred to as &quot;spaghetti code&quot; - the code twists and turns without any perceivable stucture.  This works for smaller projects, but can create a maintainability nightmare as your project grows.</p>
                
                <p>The solution?  MVC.</p>
                
                <p>The fundamental principle behind MVC (model-view-controller) architecture is <strong>separation of concerns</strong>.  The idea is to have one layer of code (the <strong>model</strong>) responsible for your data model (interacting with the database, performing various manipulations, etc), and another layer (the <strong>view</strong>) for generating the content that clients use to interact with your application.</p>
                
                <p>The <strong>controller</strong> basically does everything else, mediating the interactions between the model and the view.</p>
                
                <p>So, how do we implement this separation?  Well for the view, we use a system of <strong>templates</strong>.  Templates basically look like traditional static HTML documents, but they contain <strong>placeholders</strong> and <strong>tags</strong> that allow the controller to inject dynamic content.  Our templating engine, <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a>, takes the data provided by the controller and uses it to render a specified template.  This is done via the <code>$this-&gt;_app-&gt;render</code> method.</p>
                
                <p>For an in-depth example of how UserFrosting harnesses Twig to render your content, please see <a href="http://www.userfrosting.com/tutorials/lesson-1-new-page">Lesson 1 - creating a new page</a>.</p>
                
                <h3 id="toc_7">Theming</h3>
                
                <p>UserFrosting supports <strong>themable</strong> content, which means that the layout and appearance can vary depending on who is logged in.  UserFrosting ships with three default themes: <code>default</code>, <code>nyx</code>, and <code>root</code>.  These themes (and any new ones you create) can be associated with primary groups, and users will be assigned the theme for their primary group when they log in.</p>
                
                <p>So for example, if you assign the theme <code>nyx</code> to the group <code>Hydralisks</code>, then any user whose primary group is <code>Hydralisks</code> will load the <code>nyx</code> theme when they log in.  The exceptions are for the root user, who is always given the <code>root</code> theme, and guest users, who always get the <code>default</code> theme.</p>
                
                <p>When UserFrosting wants to render a particular template, it first looks for the template file in the user&#39;s assigned theme.  If it can&#39;t find the file there, it then looks in the <code>default</code> theme.</p>
                
                <p>This means that if you want some content to be available to all users, you should put your template into the <code>default</code> theme.  You can then customize it for different themes by overriding the file in other theme directories.</p>
                
                <p>Every theme also has a theme stylesheet, located in <code>&lt;theme-directory&gt;/css/theme.css</code>.  This stylesheet will be automatically loaded for every page.</p>
